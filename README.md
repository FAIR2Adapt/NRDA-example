# Access data from the Norwegian Research Data Archive (NRDA)

The Norwegian Research Data Archive (NIRD RDA), managed by Sigma2, is the Norwegian national open-access repository for research data, built on the open-source CKAN platform. It aims at supporting the FAIR principles, enabling the discovery, access, and reuse of datasets across scientific domains. With nearly 1,000 TB of data, the archive facilitates Open Science by providing persistent identifiers and rich metadata. 


In this Github repository, we demonstrate how to access dataset from a collection archived in the NIRD Research Data archive using the rocrate Python library.
We use RO-Crate metadata to retrieve and process files from dataset collections such as  NetCDF or Zarr files.

The RO-Crate profile is still being developed and may change.
